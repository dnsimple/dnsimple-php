## Usage

This library is a PHP client you can use to interact with the [DNSimple API v2](https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/). Here are some examples.

```php
use Dnsimple\Client;

$client = new Client("API_TOKEN");

$response = $client->identity->whoami();
$whoami = $response->getData();
$account_id = $whoami->account->id;

$response = $client->domains->listDomains($account_id);
$domains = $response->getData();
```

### Sandbox Environment

We highly recommend testing against our [sandbox environment](https://developer.dnsimple.com/sandbox/) before using our
production environment. This will allow you to avoid real purchases, live charges on your credit card, and reduce the
chance of your running up against rate limits.

The client supports both the production and sandbox environment. To switch to sandbox pass the sandbox API host using
the `base_uri` option when you construct the client:

```php
use Dnsimple\Client;

$client = new Client("API_TOKEN", ["base_uri" => 'https://api.sandbox.dnsimple.com']);
```

You will need to ensure that you are using an access token created in the sandbox environment.
Production tokens will *not* work in the sandbox environment.
